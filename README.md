BalanceBot - Unity ML-Agents ProjectMy first reinforcement learning project using Unity ML-Agents: training a capsule agent to navigate to a target using the PPO algorithm.

ðŸŽ¯ Project OverviewThis project demonstrates fundamental reinforcement learning concepts by training an agent to roll toward a target position in a 3D environment. The agent learns through trial and error using reward signals, ultimately achieving an 87% success rate.Tech Stack:

Unity 6 (2022.3+)
ML-Agents Release 20 (Python 3.10)
PyTorch
TensorBoard for visualization
